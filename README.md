# PokeTrackerService
This is the server side of the *PokeTrackr* app. Please see https://github.com/colu/PokeTrackerClient for the client side.

This is a personal project of mine to practice Android mobile development with the Spring framework after completing the series of three Android courses on Coursera: 

- Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems (https://class.coursera.org/android-001)

- Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems (https://class.coursera.org/posa-002)

- Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems (https://class.coursera.org/mobilecloud-001)

I decided on implementing an app to keep track of one's competitive Pokemon, since I have some knowledge of competitive play and would actually use this app if I wanted to seriously breed and train a good team.
